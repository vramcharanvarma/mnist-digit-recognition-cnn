# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

A simple handwritten digit recognition system built using **PyTorch** and deployed with **Streamlit**. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** and predicts digits from 0 to 9 from uploaded images.

---

## Features

- Train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset
- Achieve around 98–99% test accuracy
- Save the trained model for inference
- Upload handwritten digit images through a Streamlit web app
- Predict digits from 0–9 in real time

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Training the Model

Run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Download the MNIST dataset
- Train the CNN model
- Evaluate it on the test set
- Save the trained model as:

```
mnist_cnn.pth
```

---

## Running the Streamlit App

Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
